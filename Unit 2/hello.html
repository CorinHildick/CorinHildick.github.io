<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h3>Hello, world, can you hear me?</h3>
<p>This is paragraph text!</p>

<p>The difference between paragraph text and non-paragraph text is kind of subtle.</p>
Can you tell which lines are in a paragraph and which are not?
Here's a hint: there's a line break between this sentence and the last one.
<p>And there was another line break before this one!</p>
<p>Text in paragraph form can start new lines, and gets slightly more breathing room at the bottom of the page. This is a good reason to use it instead of just typing!</p>

<ol>Here is some ordered list text.
	What happens if there's a line break?
	How about another? Nothing.
</ol>
<ol> And if there's a second ordered list? No, just more line breaks. The indentation formatting is nice.</ol>
<ul>Here is some unordered list text.
	Does it do anything on a line break?
</ul>
<p>As it turns out, documentation is your friend. Here's how you can make an ordered list:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Start with the &lt;ol&gt; tag to create an ordered list.</li>
	<li>Inside your &lt;ol&gt; tag, use a &lt;li&gt; tag to create an entry in your ordered list.</li>
	<li>Be sure to close your list entries with &lt;/li&gt;!</li>
	<li>Once you're done, end the whole list with &lt;/ol&gt;.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use unordered lists similarly.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Normally, this just looks like bullet points.</li>
	<li>Just like ordered lists, the limit is your imagination! You can:
		<ul>
			<li>Use nested bullet points</li>
			<li>Create a picture</li>
			<ul><li>Nest your bullet points even more!</li></ul>
			<ol><li>Create a nested ordered list!</li>
			<ol><li>Create an even more nested ordered list!
				<ol><li>Graphic design is my passion.</li>

	</li>
